        Neurologic AI was founded by Nishan Ali in 2021 with an ambition to
        democratize AI&apos;s power. The companyâ€™s first client was Routine AI
        and that became a stepping stone for acquisition of additional customers
        resulting in 367% revenue surge in 2024. This led to industry
        recognitions including the Times Business Award in 2024 and the Health
        2.0 Excellence in Healthcare Award in Dubai. Under the dynamic
        leadership Nishan and his Co-founder John Gillotte, Neurologic is not
        just shaping the future of AI - it is defining it.
